# realtime-peer-sync

Take the complexity out of making P2P games or apps.

**Current state**: Lots of ideas, not much code

Goals:

* Support iOS and native Rust now, possibly Android in the future
* Allow peer devices on a network to easily act as either client or server
* Provide a minimal API to the calling application for connecting to peer devices and syncing key/value objects between them
